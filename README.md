# A high-level implementation of Aave's some features

## 1. Introduction and goal
[Aave](https://github.com/aave/aave-protocol) is a protocol of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) based on the Lending Pool (LP) concept. LPs are “virtual places” where users can deposit and borrow (paying interests) different assets sending specific transactions to a smart contract that handles them. In general, the “deposit action” has no particular constraints while the “borrow action” is subject to some requirements: the most important is that the borrower must deposit a certain amount of collateral to cover his borrowing.

Although Aave provides a wide range of functions, the goal of this work is to summarize and focus on the main functions of Aave, that are “borrow” and “deposit”, highlining when they can be executed and how they modify the state of the lending pool and the users’ balances.


## 2. Tools used
This work is written in Solidity, and it is composed of four smart contracts:
- [LendingPool.sol](https://github.com/enricopiseddu/lendingPool/blob/main/lendingPool.sol), the main contract. It is the core of this work: it defines the borrow and deposit functions and other functions used by them
- [ERC20.sol](https://github.com/enricopiseddu/lendingPool/blob/main/ERC20.sol) is the contract that defines the ERC20 Token. Its interface is the [IERC20.sol](https://github.com/enricopiseddu/lendingPool/blob/main/IERC20.sol)
- [Ownable.sol](https://github.com/enricopiseddu/lendingPool/blob/main/Ownable.sol) is the contract from which LendingPool.sol inherits: it defines the “owner” of the lending pool that is the only address that can configure it.
- Finally, the library [WadRayMath.sol](https://github.com/enricopiseddu/lendingPool/blob/main/WadRayMath.sol) provides multiplications and divisions for wads and rays, respectively decimal numbers with 18 and 27 digits. Its usage is necessary because the language handles only integer numbers.

These smart contracts are developed thanks to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and [Metamask](https://metamask.io/).


## 3. Main differences between this work and the original implementation
In order to focus on the “deposit” and “borrow” actions, this work contains some changes that do not prejudice the meaning of Aave protocol. In this section we will see these differences.

**_Asset type_**
Aave handles both ERC20 tokens and Ethers, in fact users can deposit both of them. In this work, the main smart contract handles only ERC20 tokens: Ethers are used only to compare different ERC20 tokens and assign them a value. To do this, a particular address called “oracle” can set tokens’ prices. 

**_Variable and stable borrow rate_**
When using Aave, users can decide to open a borrow position with stable or variable rate. A stable rate ensures users expect (almost exactly) how much they will pay in interests. A variable rate is a rate that adjusts according the market’s offer and demand. In particular, it depends on the actual and the optimal utilization rate of the reserve and some constants. In this work, only variable borrow rate is used because the implementation of a stable borrow rate requires a continuous rebalancing process for each user.

**_Lending Pool configuration_**
In Aave it is possible to configure each reserve, in particular, each of them can be actived, freezed and enabled as collateral. An active and unfreezed reserve accepts deposits and borrows, while a freezed reserve accepts only repay and liquidation actions. These actions, in Aave, can be executed by a smart contract called “Lending Pool Configurator”. In this work, these actions are unnecessary because once a reserve is added, it is ready to accept deposits and borrows actions.


## 4. Main features of this work

This section focuses on actors and their actions towards the Lending Pool contract.

**_Actors_**
There are different actors involved in this work. All of them are represented by addresses and are:

- the “owner” of the Lending Pool: it is the address that deploys the contract. The owner can add a reserve (that is a contract that handles a particular ERC20 token) to the lending pool and initializes it, settings some parameters;

- the “price Oracle”, an address set by the “owner” that can modify ERC20 tokens’ price;

- users: they are addresses that mostly call the borrow and the deposit functions and query the Lending Pool in order to view its state.

**_Borrow and deposit actions_**
The borrow and deposit functions are summarized by the follow pseudocodes.

```
borrow (reserve, amountToBorrow){
	require(amountToBorrow > 0)
	require(LiquidityOfLendingPool >= amountToBorrow)
	Compute User Data //(total liquidity, collateral, borrows, LoanToValue, …, HF)
	require(HF > threshold) //Health factor
	Compute the fee for the amountToBorrow
	require(fee > 0)
	Compute needed collateral to cover the borrows
	require(user’s collateral >= collateral needed)
	Update the state of Lending Pool on borrow action
	Transfer to msg.sender the amountToBorrow required
}
```

```
deposit(reserve, amountToDeposit, useAsCollateral){
	require(amount > 0)
	require(msg.sender allows the deposit) //allowance method of ERC20
	Transfer the amount to Lending Pool
	Update the state of the reserve
	Mint an amount of aTokens
	Eventually set user uses this reserve as collateral
}
```
